## Features

- Supported websites:
  - Firebase Release Notes (`https://firebase.google.com/support/releases`)
  - Monaca News (`https://ja.monaca.io/headline/`)
- RSS 2.0 feed generation

## Requirements

## Development

### Setting up the development environment

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-announcement-feed-generator.git
cd web-announcement-feed-generator
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Building

To build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles TypeScript files (.ts) to JavaScript (.js) and outputs them to the `dist` directory.

### Running during development

```bash
npm run dev -- <url> [options]
```

Or after building:
```bash
node dist/index.js <url> [options]
```

## Installation

### Local Installation

This tool is not currently published to the npm registry. Please install it using the following method:

cd get-info-from-no-feed-page

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

- `--with-date`: Add date to the output filename
- `-s, --start-date <date>`: Filter announcements after specified date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `-e, --end-date <date>`: Filter announcements before specified date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `-ic, --include-category <text>`: Filter announcements where category contains specified text
- `-ec, --exclude-category <text>`: Filter announcements where category doesn't contain specified text

## Examples

### Generate feed for a specific site

```bash
web-feed https://ja.monaca.io/headline/ --with-date
```

### Generate feeds for all sites

```bash
web-feed all --with-date
```

### Export CSV with filtering conditions

```bash
web-feed https://firebase.google.com/support/releases --start-date 2023-01-01 --include-category important
```

### Run in differential mode

```bash
web-feed https://ja.monaca.io/headline/ -d
```

## Output Files

The program generates two files:

1. RSS 2.0 feed (XML file)
2. CSV file with the announcement list

By default, output filenames are automatically generated based on the domain and path of the webpage.
When using the `--with-date` option, the date is added to the filename.

## Issues & Improvements

- To add support for a new website, create a new scraper class in the `src/scrapers/` directory and register it in `scraper-factory.ts`.
- If there's a version mismatch between ChromeDriver and Chrome browser, install the appropriate version of ChromeDriver.
